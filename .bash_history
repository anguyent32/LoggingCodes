The city of Grampon wants to know where all its public vehicles (garbage trucks, police cars, etc.) are at all times, so the city has GPS transmitters installed in all the vehicles. What kind of control is this? (D1, L1.3.1) 
Question options:
A) Administrative
B) Entrenched
C) Physical
D) Technical
Hide question 1 feedback
D is correct. A GPS unit is part of the IT environment, so this is a technical control. A is incorrect. The GPS unit itself is not a rule or a policy or a process; it is part of the IT environment, so D is a better answer. B is incorrect; "entrenched" is not a term commonly used to describe a particular type of security control, and is used here only as a distractor. C is incorrect; while a GPS unit is a tangible object, it is also part of the IT environment, and it does not interact directly with other physical objects in order to prevent action, so "technical" is a better descriptor, and D is a better answer.  Question 2		1 / 1 point; Preenka works at an airport. There are red lines painted on the ground next to the runway; Preenka has been instructed that nobody can step or drive across a red line unless they request, and get specific permission from, the control tower. This is an example of a(n)______ control. (D1, L1.3.1) 
Question options:
A) Physical
B) Administrative
C) Critical
D) Technical
Hide question 2 feedback
B is correct. The process of requesting and getting permission, and the painted signage, are examples of administrative controls. A is incorrect; while the line is painted on the ground (and the ground is a tangible object), the line does not actually act to prevent or control anything—the line is a symbol and indicator; Preenka could easily walk across the line, if Preenka chose to do so. C is incorrect; "critical" is not a term commonly used to describe a particular type of security control, and is used here only as a distractor. D is incorrect; a painted line is not an IT system or part of the IT environment. 
Question 3		0 / 1 point
Of the following, which would probably not be considered a threat? (D1, L1.2.1)
Question options:
A) Natural disaster
B) Unintentional damage to the system caused by a user
C) A laptop with sensitive data on it
D) An external attacker trying to gain unauthorized access to the environment
Hide question 3 feedback
C is correct. A laptop, and the data on it, are assets, not threats. All the other answers are examples of threats, as they all have the potential to cause adverse impact to the organization and the organization's assets. 

Question 4		0 / 1 point
Tina is an (ISC)² member and is invited to join an online group of IT security enthusiasts. After attending a few online sessions, Tina learns that some participants in the group are sharing malware with each other, in order to use it against other organizations online. What should Tina do? (D1, L1.5.1) 
Question options:
A) Nothing
B) Stop participating in the group
C) Report the group to law enforcement
D) Report the group to (ISC)²
Hide question 4 feedback
B is the best answer. The (ISC)² Code of Ethics requires that members "protect society, the common good, necessary public trust and confidence, and the infrastructure"; this would include a prohibition against disseminating and deploying malware for offensive purposes. However, the Code does not make (ISC)² members into law enforcement officers; there is no requirement to get involved in legal matters beyond the scope of personal responsibility. Tina should stop participating in the group, and perhaps (for Tina's own protection) document when participation started and stopped, but no other action is necessary on Tina's part. 
Question 5		1 / 1 point
Zarma is an (ISC)² member and a security analyst for Triffid Corporation. One of Zarma's colleagues is interested in getting an (ISC)2  certification and asks Zarma what the test questions are like. What should Zarma do? (D1, L1.5.1) 
Question options:
A) Inform (ISC)²
B) Explain the style and format of the questions, but no detail 
C) Inform the colleague's supervisor
D) Nothing
Hide question 5 feedback
B is the best answer. It is all right to explain the format of the exam, and even to share your own impressions of how challenging and difficult you found the exam to be. But in order to protect the security of the test, and to adhere to the (ISC)² Code of Ethics ("advance and protect the profession"), Zarma should not share any explicit information about details of the exam or reveal any actual questions. 
Question 6		1 / 1 point
Grampon municipal code requires that all companies that operate within city limits will have a set of processes to ensure employees are safe while working with hazardous materials. Triffid Corporation creates a checklist of activities employees must follow while working with hazardous materials inside Grampon city limits. The municipal code is a ______, and the Triffid checklist is a ________. (D1, L1.4.2) 
Question options:
A) Law, procedure
B) Standard, law
C) Law, standard
D) Policy, law
Hide question 6 feedback
A is correct. The municipal code was created by a governmental body and is a legal mandate; this is a law. The Triffid checklist is a detailed set of actions which must be used by Triffid employees in specific circumstances; this is a procedure. B and C are incorrect; neither document is recognized throughout the industry, so neither is a standard. D is incorrect; neither document is a strategic internal overview issued by senior management, so neither is a policy. 
Question 7		1 / 1 point
Sophia is visiting Las Vegas and decides to put a bet on a particular number on a roulette wheel. This is an example of _________. (D1, L1.2.2) 
Question options:
A) Acceptance
B) Avoidance
C) Mitigation
D) Transference
Hide question 7 feedback
A is correct. Sophia is accepting the risk that the money will be lost, even though the likelihood is high; Sophia has decided that the potential benefit (winning the bet), while low in likelihood, is worth the risk. B is incorrect; if Sophia used avoidance, Sophia would not place the bet. C is incorrect; mitigation involves applying a control to reduce the risk. There is no practical (or legal) way to reduce the risk that Sophia will lose the bet. D is incorrect; if Sophia wanted to transfer the risk, Sophia might ask some friends to each put up a portion of the bet, so that they would all share the loss (or winnings) from the bet. 
Question 8		0 / 1 point
For which of the following systems would the security concept of availability probably be most important? (D1, L1.1.1) 
Question options:
A) Medical systems that store patient data
B) Retail records of past transactions
C) Online streaming of camera feeds that display historical works of art in museums around the world
D) Medical systems that monitor patient condition in an intensive care unit
Hide question 8 feedback
D is correct. Information that reflects patient condition is data that necessarily must be kept available in real time, because that data is directly linked to the patients' well-being (and possibly their life). This is, by far, the most important of the options listed. A is incorrect because stored data, while important, is not as critical to patient health as the monitoring function listed in answer D. B is incorrect because retail transactions do not constitute a risk to health and human safety. C is incorrect because displaying artwork does not reflect a risk to health and human safety; also because the loss of online streaming does not actually affect the asset (the artwork in the museum) in any way—the art will still be in the museum, regardless of whether the camera is functioning. 

Question 9		0 / 1 point
Triffid Corporation has a policy that all employees must receive security awareness instruction before using email; the company wants to make employees aware of potential phishing attempts that the employees might receive via email. What kind of control is this instruction? (D1, L1.3.1) 
Question options:
A) Administrative
B) Finite
C) Physical
D) Technical
Hide question 9 feedback
A is correct. Both the policy and the instruction are administrative controls; rules and governance are administrative. B is incorrect; "finite" is not a term commonly used to describe a particular type of security control, and is used here only as a distractor. C is incorrect; training is not a tangible object, so this is not a physical control. D is incorrect; training is not part of the IT environment, so it is not a technical control. 

Question 10		1 / 1 point
For which of the following assets is integrity probably the most important security aspect? (D1, L1.1.1) 
Question options:
A) One frame of a streaming video
B) The file that contains passwords used to authenticate users
C) The color scheme of a marketing website
D) Software that checks the spelling of product descriptions for a retail website
Hide question 10 feedback
B is correct. If a password file is modified, the impact to the environment could be significant; there is a possibility that all authorized users could be denied access, or that anyone (including unauthorized users) could be granted access. The integrity of the password file is probably the most crucial of the four options listed. A is incorrect because one frame of an entire film, if modified, probably would have little to no effect whatsoever on the value of the film to the viewer; a film has thousands (or tens of thousands, or millions) of frames. C is incorrect because a change in marketing material, while significant, is not as crucial as the integrity of the password file described in Answer B. D is incorrect because a typo in a product description is not likely to be as important as the integrity of the password file described in Answer B. 

Question 11		1 / 1 point
The Triffid Corporation publishes a policy that states all personnel will act in a manner that protects health and human safety. The security office is tasked with writing a detailed set of processes on how employees should wear protective gear such as hardhats and gloves when in hazardous areas. This detailed set of processes is a _________. (D1, L1.4.1) 
Question options:
A) Policy
B) Procedure
C) Standard
D)Law
Hide question 11 feedback
B is correct. A detailed set of processes used by a specific organization is a procedure. A is incorrect; the policy is the overarching document that requires the procedure be created and implemented. C is incorrect. The procedure is not recognized and implemented throughout the industry; it is used internally. D is incorrect; the procedure was created by Triffid Corporation, not a governmental body. 

Question 12		0 / 1 point
Which of the following is an example of a "something you are" authentication factor? (D1, L1.1.1) 
Question options:
A) A credit card presented to a cash machine
B) Your password and PIN
C) A user ID
D) A photograph of your face
Hide question 12 feedback
D is correct. A facial photograph is something you are—your appearance. A is incorrect because a credit card is an example of an authentication factor that is something you have. B is incorrect because passwords and PINs are examples of authentication factors that are something you know. C is incorrect because a user ID is an identity assertion, not an authentication factor. 

Question 13		1 / 1 point
The city of Grampon wants to ensure that all of its citizens are protected from malware, so the city council creates a rule that anyone caught creating and launching malware within the city limits will receive a fine and go to jail. What kind of rule is this? (D1, L1.4.1) 
Question options:
A) Policy
B) Procedure
C) Standard
D) Law
Hide question 13 feedback
D is correct. The city council is a governmental body making a legal mandate; this is a law. A is incorrect; the rule is not a policy used by a specific organization, but instead applies to anyone within the jurisdiction of the Grampon city council. B is incorrect; this rule is not a process to follow. C is incorrect; this rule is not recognized outside the jurisdiction of the Grampon city council. 

Question 14		1 / 1 point
Aphrodite is a member of (ISC)² and a data analyst for Triffid Corporation. While Aphrodite is reviewing user log data, Aphrodite discovers that another Triffid employee is violating the acceptable use policy and watching streaming videos during work hours. What should Aphrodite do? (D1, L1.5.1) 
Question options:
A) Inform (ISC)²
B) Inform law enforcement
C) Inform Triffid management
D) Nothing
Hide question 14 feedback
C is the best answer. Aphrodite is required by the (ISC)² Code of Ethics to "provide diligent and competent service to principals." This includes reporting policy violations to Triffid management (Triffid is the principal, in this case). A policy violation of this type is not a crime, so law enforcement does not need to be involved, and (ISC)² has no authority over Triffid policy enforcement or employees. 

Question 15		1 / 1 point
A vendor sells a particular operating system (OS). In order to deploy the OS securely on different platforms, the vendor publishes several sets of instructions on how to install it, depending on which platform the customer is using. This is an example of a ________. (D1, L1.4.2) 
Question options:
A) Law
B) Procedure
C) Standard
D) Policy
Hide question 15 feedback
B is correct. This is a set of instructions to perform a particular task, so it is a procedure (several procedures, actually—one for each platform). A is incorrect; the instructions are not a governmental mandate. C is incorrect, because the instructions are particular to a specific product, not accepted throughout the industry. D is incorrect, because the instructions are not particular to a given organization. 

Question 16		0 / 1 point
The European Union (EU) law that grants legal protections to individual human privacy. (D1, L1.1.1) 
Question options:
A) The Privacy Human Rights Act
B) The General Data Protection Regulation
C) The Magna Carta
D) The Constitution
Hide question 16 feedback
B is correct: The GDPR is the EU law that treats privacy as a human right. A is incorrect because there is no Privacy Human Rights Act, which is only used here as a distractor. C is incorrect because the Magna Carta is a British law describing the relationship between the monarchy and the people, and does not mention privacy. D is incorrect because the Constitution is the basis of United States federal law, and does not mention privacy. 

Question 17		1 / 1 point
Hoshi is an (ISC)2  member who works for the Triffid Corporation as a data manager. Triffid needs a new firewall solution, and Hoshi is asked to recommend a product for Triffid to acquire and implement. Hoshi's cousin works for a firewall vendor; that vendor happens to make the best firewall available. What should Hoshi do? (D1, L1.5.1) 
Question options:
A) recommend a different vendor/product
B) recommend the cousin's product
C) Hoshi should ask to be recused from the task 
D) disclose the relationship, but recommend the vendor/product
Hide question 17 feedback
D is the best answer. According to the third Canon of the ISC2 Code of Ethics, members are required to "provide diligent and competent service to principals." Hoshi's principal here is Triffid, Hoshi's employer. It would be inappropriate for Hoshi to select the cousin's product solely based upon the family relationship; however, if the cousin's product is, in fact, the best choice for Triffid, then Hoshi should recommend that product. In order to avoid any appearance of impropriety or favoritism, Hoshi needs to declare the relationship when making the recommendation. 
Question 18		1 / 1 point
Druna is a security practitioner tasked with ensuring that laptops are not stolen from the organization's offices. Which sort of security control would probably be best for this purpose? (D1, L1.3.1) 
Question options:
A) Technical
B) Obverse
C) Physical
D) Administrative
Hide question 18 feedback
C is the best answer. Because laptops are tangible objects, and Druna is trying to ensure that these objects are not moved from a certain place, physical controls are probably best for the purpose. A is incorrect; technical controls might help detect an attempt to steal a laptop, or locate the laptop after it has been stolen, but won't prevent the laptop from being taken. B is incorrect; "obverse" is not a term commonly used to describe a particular type of security control, and is used here only as a distractor. D is incorrect; administrative controls may help reduce theft, such as ensuring that laptops are not left in a place unobserved, but won't prevent the laptop from being taken. 

Question 19		1 / 1 point
(ISC)² publishes a Common Body of Knowledge (CBK) that IT security practitioners should be familiar with; this is recognized throughout the industry as a set of material that is useful for practitioners to  refer to. Certifications can be issued for demonstrating expertise in this Common Body of Knowledge. What kind of document is the Common Body of Knowledge? (D1, L1.4.1) 
Question options:
A) Policy
B) Procedure
C) Standard
D) Law
Hide question 19 feedback
 C is correct. The Common Body of Knowledge is used throughout the industry, recognized among many people, countries and organizations. This is a standard. A is incorrect; the CBK is not a set of internal rules used for a particular organization; it is used throughout the industry. B is incorrect. The CBK is not a process that is followed; it is a set of information. D is incorrect; the CBK is not mandated by a governmental body. 

Question 20		0 / 1 point
Kerpak works in the security office of a medium-sized entertainment company. Kerpak is asked to assess a particular threat, and he suggests that the best way to counter this threat would be to purchase and implement a particular security solution. This is an example of _______. (D1, L1.2.2) 
Question options:
A) Acceptance
B) Avoidance
C) Mitigation
D) Transference
Hide question 20 feedback
C is correct. Applying a security solution (a type of control) is an example of mitigation. A is incorrect; if Kerpak suggested acceptance, then the threat, and the acceptance of the associated risk, only needs to be documented—no other action is necessary. B is incorrect; if Kerpak suggested avoidance, the course of action would be to cease whatever activity was associated with the threat. D is incorrect; if Kerpak suggested transference, this would involve forming some sort of risk-sharing relationship with an external party, such as an insurance underwriter. 

Question 21		0 / 1 point
When should a business continuity plan (BCP) be activated? (D2, L2.2.1) 
Question options:
A) As soon as possible
B) At the very beginning of a disaster 
C) When senior management decides
D) When instructed to do so by regulators
Hide question 21 feedback
C is correct. A senior manager with the proper authority must initiate the BCP. A is incorrect; this answer has no context—there is no way to know when "as soon as possible" would be. B is incorrect; typically, it is impossible to determine the "beginning" of a disaster. D is incorrect; not all organizations are in regulated industries, and regulators do not supervise disaster response. 

Question 22		1 / 1 point
What is the risk associated with delaying resumption of full normal operations after a disaster? (D2, L2.3.1) 
Question options:
A) People might be put in danger
B) The impact of running alternate operations for extended periods
C) A new disaster might emerge 
D) Competition
Hide question 22 feedback
B is correct. Alternate operations are typically more costly than normal operations, in terms of impact to the organization; extended alternate operations could harm the organization as much as a disaster. A is incorrect; typically, alternate operations are safer than normal operations. C is incorrect; this would actually be an argument for delaying alternate operations, but it doesn't make much sense. D is incorrect; competition is always a risk, but doesn't have anything to do with DR efforts. 

Question 23		1 / 1 point
Which of the following is likely to be included in the business continuity plan? (D2, L2.2.1) 
Question options:
A) Alternate work areas for personnel affected by a natural disaster 
B) The organization's strategic security approach 
C) Last year's budget information
D) Log data from all systems
Hide question 23 feedback
A is correct. The business continuity plan should include provisions for alternate work sites, if the primary site is affected by an interruption, such as a natural disaster. B is incorrect; the organization's strategic security approach should be included in the organization's security policy. C is incorrect; budgetary information is not typically included in the business continuity plan. D is incorrect; log data is not typically included in the business continuity plan. 
Question 24		1 / 1 point
True or False? Business continuity planning is a reactive procedure that restores business operations after a disruption occurs. 
Question options:
	A) True
	B) False
Hide question 24 feedback
B is correct. Business continuity planning is proactive preparation for restoring operations after disruption. Members from across the organizations participate in the planning to ensure all systems, processes and operations are accounted for in the plan. A is incorrect; business continuity planning is a proactive procedure to prepare for the restoration of operations after disruption. 
Question 25		0 / 1 point
What is the most important goal of a business continuity effort? (D2, L2.2.1) 
Question options:
A) Ensure all IT systems function during a potential interruption
B) Ensure all business activities are preserved during a potential disaster 
C) Ensure the organization survives a disaster
D) Preserve health and human safety
Hide question 25 feedback
In all security efforts, preserving health and human safety is paramount, so D is the correct answer. A, B and C are incorrect because D takes precedence over any of them. 
Question 26		1 / 1 point
What is the goal of an incident response effort? (D2, L2.1.1) 
Question options:
A) No incidents ever happen
B) Reduce the impact of incidents on operations
C) Punish wrongdoers
D) Save money
Hide question 26 feedback
B is correct. The overall incident response effort is to reduce the impact incidents might have on the organization's operations. A is incorrect; there is no such thing as "zero risk" or "100% security." C is incorrect; security practitioners are neither law enforcers nor superheroes. D is incorrect; incident response efforts may actually cost the organization more money than the impact of a given incident or set of incidents –  "impact" can be measured in other ways than monetary results. 

Question 27		0 / 1 point
Who approves the incident response policy? (D2, L2.1.1) 
Question options:
A) (ISC)²
B) Senior management
C) The security manager
D) Investors
Hide question 27 feedback
B is correct. The organization's senior management are the only entities authorized to accept risk on behalf of the organization, and therefore all organizational policies must be approved by senior management. A is incorrect; (ISC)² has no authority over individual organizations. C is incorrect; the security manager will likely be involved in crafting and implementing the policy, but only senior management can approve it. D is incorrect; investors leave policy review and approval to senior management. 
Question 28		0 / 1 point
Which of the following is probably most useful at the perimeter of a property? (D3, L3.2.1) 
Question options:
A) A safe
B) A fence
C) A data center
D) A centralized log storage facility
Hide question 28 feedback
B is the best answer. Of the options listed, a fence would be most useful at the perimeter of a property. A, C and D are incorrect, because those contain high-value assets which would be better located away from the perimeter of the property, so they can be protected with multiple security controls of varying types. 
Question 29		0 / 1 point
Which of the following would be considered a logical access control? 
Question options:
A) An iris reader that allows an employee to enter a controlled area
B) A fingerprint reader that allows an employee to enter a controlled area
C) A fingerprint reader that allows an employee to access a laptop computer
D) A chain attached to a laptop computer that connects it to furniture so it cannot be taken
Hide question 29 feedback
Logical access controls limit who can gain user access to a device/system. C is the correct answer. A, B and D are all physical controls, as they limit physical access to areas and assets. 
Question 30		1 / 1 point
Visitors to a secure facility need to be controlled. Controls useful for managing visitors include all of the following except: (D3, L3.2.1) 
Question options:
A) Sign-in sheet/tracking log
B) Fence
C) Badges that differ from employee badges
D) Receptionist
Hide question 30 feedback
B is the best answer. A fence is useful for controlling visitors, authorized users and potential intruders. This is the only control listed among the possible answers that is not specific to visitors. A, C and D are all controls that should be used to manage visitors. 
Question 31		0 / 1 point
Prachi works as a database administrator for Triffid, Inc. Prachi is allowed to add or delete users, but is not allowed to read or modify the data in the database itself. When Prachi logs onto the system, an access control list (ACL) checks to determine which permissions Prachi has.  
In this situation, what is the database? (D3, L3.1.1) 
Question options:
A) The object
B) The rule
C) The subject
D) The site
Hide question 31 feedback
A is correct. Prachi is manipulating the database, so the database is the object in the subject-object-rule relationship in this case. B and C are incorrect, because the database is the object in this situation. D is incorrect because "site" has no meaning in this context. 
Question 32		0 / 1 point
Bruce is the branch manager of a bank. Bruce wants to determine which personnel at the branch can get access to systems, and under which conditions they can get access. Which access control methodology would allow Bruce to make this determination? (D3, L3.3.1)
Question options:
A) MAC (mandatory access control)
B) DAC (discretionary access control)
C) RBAC (role-based access control)
D) Defense-in-depth
Hide question 32 feedback
Discretionary access control is a model wherein permissions are granted by operational managers, allowing them to make the determination of which personnel can get specific access to particular assets controlled by the manager. B is the correct answer. A is incorrect; in mandatory access control, managers do not have the authority (discretion) to determine who gets access to specific assets. C is incorrect; in role-based access control, managers do not have the authority to determine who gets access to particular assets. D is incorrect; defense in depth is not an access control model, it's a security philosophy.

 Gelbi is a Technical Support analyst for Triffid, Inc. Gelbi sometimes is required to install or remove software. Which of the following could be used to describe Gelbi's account? (D3, L3.1.1) 
Question options:
A) Privileged
B) Internal
C) External
D) User
Hide question 33 feedback
A is Correct. This is the description of a privileged account; an account that typically needs greater permissions than a basic user. B and C are incorrect; the question does not specify whether Gelbi connects to the environment from within the network, or from outside. D is incorrect; this is too vague—Gelbi is a user, but has permissions that are typically greater than what basic users have. 

Question 34		1 / 1 point
Which of the following is a biometric access control mechanism? (D3, L3.2.1) 
Question options:
A) A badge reader
B) A copper key
C) A fence with razor tape on it
D) A door locked by a voiceprint identifier
Hide question 34 feedback
D is correct. A lock that opens according to a person's voice is a type of biometric access control. A, B and C are all access control mechanisms, but none of them are based on unique physiological characteristics of a person, so they are not biometric systems. 
Question 35		1 / 1 point
Gary is unable to log in to the production environment. Gary tries three times and is then locked out of trying again for one hour. Why? (D3, L3.3.1)
Question options:
A) Gary is being punished
B) The network is tired
C) Users remember their credentials if they are given time to think about it 
D) Gary's actions look like an attack
Hide question 35 feedback
Repeated login attempts can resemble an attack on the network; attackers might try to log in to a user's account multiple times, using different credentials, in a short time period, in an attempt to determine the proper credentials. D is correct. A is incorrect; security policies and processes are not intended to punish employees. B is incorrect; IT systems do not get tired. C is incorrect; the delay is not designed to help users remember credentials. 

Question 36		0 / 1 point
All of the following are typically perceived as drawbacks to biometric systems, except: (D3, L3.2.1) 
Question options:
A) Lack of accuracy
B) Potential privacy concerns
C) Retention of physiological data past the point of employment 
D) Legality
Hide question 36 feedback
A is correct. Biometric systems can be extremely accurate, especially when compared with other types of access controls. B, C and D are all potential concerns when using biometric data, so those answers are incorrect in this context.

Prina is a database manager. Prina is allowed to add new users to the database, remove current users and create new usage functions for the users. Prina is not allowed to read the data in the fields of the database itself. This is an example of: (D3, L3.3.1)
Question options:
A) Role-based access controls (RBAC)
B) Mandatory access controls (MAC)
C) Discretionary access controls (DAC)
D) Alleviating threat access controls (ATAC)
Hide question 37 feedback
Role-based access controls often function in this manner, where the employee's job responsibilities dictate exactly which kinds of access the employee has. This also enforces the concept of "least privilege." A is the correct answer. B and C are incorrect; those access control models don't function in the same way as RBAC. D is incorrect; there is no ATAC in this context, and the term is only used here as a distractor. 

Question 38		1 / 1 point

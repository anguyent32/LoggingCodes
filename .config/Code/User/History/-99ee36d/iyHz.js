//--- Easy
//create a variable and assign it a number
let num = 1
//minus 10 from that number
num = num - 10
//print that number to the console
console.log(num) // *NOTICE*: log(num) is a function call that call the function log and num is an argument
//--- Medium
//create a variable that holds a value from the input
let inputVal = document.querySelector('danceDanceREvolution').value
//add 25 to that number
inputVal = inputVal + 25
//alert that number

//--- Hard
//create a variable that holds the h1

//add an event listener to that element that console logs the sum of the two previous variables
